elcome to apology alive we're a former Christian takes a look at the claims of
Christians live here from Paul Gia studios in Eastern Canada Nova Scotia
where it is a starting to be finally a lovely day and where it is early in the day and my
dog has yet to be walked so we will see how she does throughout this stream that may be the deciding factor but as you
guys know normally I look at the claims of Christians and that usually means video clips or articles and that kind of
things but today we have an actual Christian to join us we have
my friend and uh well sort of the original
inspiration for this channel so it's great to have you here Eric hoband welcome hey buddy Paul great to be with you
today man thanks for letting me hang out and enjoy a good conversation with you I always enjoy our conversations and our
texts and being able to bounce ideas off each other so thank you great and uh
so today we are here not to debate really anything we are here to have a
conversation Eric and I came into each other's spheres around around young
Earth creationism that's not what we're here to talk about today neither our scientists so we would get actual scientists to come in and do
that if
that's what we wanted to do uh also weirdly it's Easter week and I didn't plan this very well we should have had a
resurrection conversation but we'll do that another time uh but what has been on my heart in my old uh vernacular has
been morality and how we talk about morality when I was a Christian I feel
like my uh I didn't need I didn't feel like I needed anything more to know that God
was going to tell me what was moral and what was not and I so I didn't give it any more thought and more particularly
anymore uh didn't put words to to it or think deeply about it and even after I left
Christianity it took me a while to sort of get there so now I'm mired in what I think are fascinating conversations
about morality and I know my good friend Eric has thought deeply about this for a
long time and so we're gonna see if we are on the same page at all and kind of
roll it around um we will be allowing towards the end of the conversation if anyone wants to
submit a Super Chat we will be answering questions either for Eric or for myself as long as they are respectful and we
won't be asking any answering questions today about either our extended families so you know within those parameters we'd
love to to hear what you guys have to say but Eric morality
so I know I warned you in advance that one of the things I was just going to ask you was
how do you see it and I think that you've actually prepared a little bit of something for us to come to talk through
are you comfortable how about you layout for us how you see Morality In A Brief sense
and then we'll use that as a springboard does that sound good yeah I'd I'd love to to take one step
back even from that and to have one different conversation first and then
jump into morality if that's okay let's do it actually can I can we do two little subjects first uh because I feel
like you know that I you know we've had this conversation I disagree every time
I hear you say on your channel a former Christian examining the claims of Christians sure and that's my first
every time you say that I'm like oh I just I cringe and uh I go you know that
according to Christianity Christianity is a relationship with Jesus Christ and now you would say I thought I had one
but I didn't have one so it's not like somebody can say I used to be a Christian they can only say I thought I
was a Christian and so it's really and and just like we're gonna have a conversation on morality and these these details kind of matter I go that
detail
actually matters because you're you're you're you're not being honest you're
being immoral when you if I can start off right in that sure when you present the idea I used to be a Christian and
now I'm not and I'm examining the claims of Christians so automatically I go man I you're my friend I've told you this
offline talk about it online uh somebody who's a Christian is somebody who has a
relationship with Jesus Christ who has made God the Lord of their reasoning and so for you to now reason that he is not
you can't logically say that you used to be a Christian logically all you can say is I used to be deluded into thinking I
was and now I'm no longer in your mind deluded I'm not a Christian does that
well this means up our whole conversation because that means you and I are no longer defining Christianity
the same way right and so it does make it does make weirdly sense that it's your label to adopt and so you should be
able to Define it the trouble is I talk to so many Christians and everyone defines Christian Christianity
differently so for me Christianity I believed I was a Christian but right
now I think if the definition of Christianity is someone in relationship with a risen Jesus then I don't think
anyone is a Christian right because I don't I think you are deluding yourself
into that as well I agree but you would also have to say if that is what a Christian is you can only say you were
deluded you cannot say that you are a Christian right that is well
uh yes that that would be correct that I was deluded so I I held I have thought about it's a little wordy it's not good
for Branding but I have thought about using a former a former person who used the label of Christian because that's
what I did I used the label of Christian right now if anyone comes to me with a label of Christian
I now no longer know true Scotsman that right like when I was a Christian I would have said like a lot of Catholics
I know aren't Christians and definitely JW's aren't Christians and even you know a lot of very liberal people they they
say they're Christians but I wouldn't have agreed so on on this side of the fence now I just like if you use the label you use
the label um so do you think how how would I best clarify myself in a
way that would be palpable to someone like you if when I say that I
formally use the label of Christian would that is that more palpable or the question is do you want to be consistent
I mean and if we're standing again we're going to literally be talking about two different World Views here we're going
to be talking about a Biblical worldview and we're going to be talking about a non-biblical worldview and I go if you
want to stand on the non-biblical worldview you don't even have to be consistent there's no there's no reason there's no there's nothing
holding you
to consistency just like we're going to talk about morality and there's nothing on this worldview there's nothing holding you to morality if we're
standing on the biblical review where we do want to be consistent and we do want to have truth I go yeah it would make
sense to borrow the Christian worldview and put it over here it would make sense to be consistent and the only way to be
consistent is to claim I used to be deluded into thinking I had a relationship with Christ now I know I do
not because I don't believe that he is the savior or the Messiah or risen and so I'm now no longer deluded that's the
only consistent way and you can try to try to flower that up to make it more palatable but that's the only consistent
thing I feel like that uh that may if you heard someone say that though you
that that's kind of insulting into Christianity and I I of course just like you want to be welcoming to
non-believers or do you think that is a welcoming statement for me to say I think it's a blessing I mean how many
pastors have gone from preaching in the Pulpit to now no longer preaching in the pulpit and I go wow Paul I'm thankful
that you now know that you do not have a relationship with God I'm thankful that you understand this truth so and God has
given you more time so that you still can come to that knowledge right
I've taken off my sheep's clothing as it were I'm no longer a wolf in sheep's clothing
and as the Bible used to talk about I'm now just the wolf well that's a that's a good way to put
it and even Matthew 7 21 the scariest verse in the Bible many are going to come to me and say didn't I do all these things and he's going to
stay depart
from me I never knew you so exactly I think there's many in the church that are deluded into thinking they are
Christian that's the way I was I was raised in a Christian home I mean raised by two amazing parents that loved me
that loved God that that wanted the best for my life that instilled a lot of Truth in me and I started questioning
things at 18 years old and started going on this journey to to know is this is this actually true is what I'm being
taught true is is there another way that's true and uh I go if I would have died at 18 I don't think I would have
been a Believer I didn't get saved until watching hell's best kept secret by Ray comfort and realizing the modern gospel
come to Jesus because he wants to give you a good life and the and the biblical gospel man we are all sinners who need a
savior I I my I need saved from my bad works and I need saved from my good
works because my my good works are not good compared to the Holiness of God so it really
um and and again I know we're we're kind of we're trying to get some morality but that's right that distinction I guess
yeah it's your show we can go wherever we want right um that distinction of I used to be a Christian to me that's the real slap in
the face to real Christians because you cannot say I used to be a Christian
because a Christian is somebody who has a relationship with Jesus Christ so that to me the slap on the face and I get it
it's good for Branding it sounds great it it might um be more persuasive to
people if you will to say I used to be where you're at now I know better it's kind of what it sounds like because
there you know some people use the opposite I used to be an atheist and now I'm no longer an atheist so I think
there's there's um yeah it works well for least Roble and Jay Werner Wallace yeah and so I
don't know if you make fun of them maybe you ought to make fun of yourself too oh I I'm all for that so I'm over there and
actually yeah and I'm not I hope I'm not being I when when presented with that I I I'll
take that on board absolutely I you know I was deluded then and I think you are too so uh so yeah so all good
um that was topic one you wanted to cover apparently I've given you pain Point number two let's cover that what is that that's it pain Point
number two
well that is just the the Common Ground what common ground are we going to use
to even have this conversation and uh to get to Common Ground you and I have talked about this briefly over the years
one time a little bit in depth several years ago but that gets down to how do we know anything to be real and I have
broken it down into like a simple three-step process and I thought man it takes like three or four minutes to hit
this three-step process you already know it so you kind of know what that three-step process is oh I don't need
those yet so okay um no worries um but in that three-step process I think it lays it I should have
I actually have slides for this I should have made those but um in the three-step process it really
helps us understand what Foundation what do we need to have this Common Ground so you've heard the argument but let's just
walk through it for people that haven't heard it if you could be wrong about something can you claim that you know
that it's true is the first thought experiment we do so if I said the speed limit's 35 miles an hour on a road over
here but I could be wrong if I say I could be wrong do I know what the speed limit
actually is the answer is well uh so you and I
let's not just give me we were going to do a long fight about this and maybe we can if you want to but I think knowledge
is Justified true belief and I think you can actually know something and still be entirely uncertain about it
so um yeah I don't want to stop on your
steps unless you want to pause there and talk about that but that I think that comes down to the foundation of the
issue of can we have any absolute certainty
yeah and I I I don't think absolute certainty is uh
necessary or achievable and that very claim is an absolute claim
uh yeah not because I'm not absolutely certain about it that's an absolute it's
an absolute claim but if you said Paul are you absolutely certain about that I've said no because I don't
feel absolutely so I'm I'm open to being wrong about that right but the the logical fallacy that
we undergo because if we can't get down to it we can actually have truth we can have we can have real truth real
you know true belief we can have knowledge and we don't have a basis for knowledge well then
sitting here and talking about morality is if we don't ground it in something we're
gonna we're talking we're talking which candy bar do you like the best which is the best candy bar which is the best
flavor of ice cream or what's our favorite colors it just turns into this
it turns into this personal preference thing if we don't find a way to ground it
does that make sense uh it does make sense and I actually do think that morality is closer to the candy bar
thing sorry about my puppy it's just the way people are walking their dogs right now she's crazy
um I do think morality is closer to the candy bar than the than the absolute
certain knowledge but um let's let's get in some definitions so that we are actually on the same page uh react truth
is what truth is that which conforms to the mind of God
all right and so I think truth is that which conforms to reality so you're not we're
what is reality reality who's who's reality uh
there is only one reality is your reality God doesn't exist uh
right and so one of us is wrong about that for sure one of us is really wrong I would go with you there like one of us
absolutely so um the way we just we just said absolutely
see this is the problem just hit the issue right right there
yeah absolutely somebody's writing somebody's wrong that right there undermines your very
claim that we can't know absolute right and wrong no that that just means that we live in a world
where I have presupposed laws of non-contradiction is that absolutely true
no I presupposed it I've presupposed because I have yet absolutely true that you are presupposing it
no you could convince so I I didn't used to think that I was presupposing it and the philosopher actually convinced me
that I was and I'm I'm sure probably could be convinced otherwise that I'm not presupposing it but as to
the best information that I've got I'm presupposing yeah yeah and that's that's again where this
problem comes down because we're going to be talking in terms of absolute while you're denying absolute so we're we're
going to be constantly having this illogical conversation and going back and forth between these two World Views
and it ends up creating lots and lots of confusion let me um
yeah that's what I wanted you to do without my weird interruptions
so if I claim I could be wrong about something I can't claim that I know that it's true
because if I could if I claim I could be wrong about something I cannot claim that I know that it's true so kind of
that's a that's a simple thought process um so the the the next thought on this
is out of all the knowledge in the universe I mean out of all chemistry and astronomy and uh physics and you know
computer science women's Brains men's Brains your dog's brain where every nut is buried from every squirrel in history
throughout all time like out of everything there is to know how much knowledge do we actually have and we
would say very very little let's pretend it's one percent
let's pretend we think we've got one percent is it possible out of the 99 of
knowledge that we don't have that something could contradict or prove wrong the one percent that we think that we do have
well the answer would to be yes it could therefore we could be wrong about the
one percent of knowledge that we think we have and if we could be wrong can we claim that we know that it's true no we can't
now here's the problem logically we've come to the conclusion we could be wrong about the one percent if we could be
wrong about the one percent that means we don't even know the one percent well that would mean we don't know anything at all
the problem is that's an absurdity that leaves us in absurdity world and
philosophers throughout time have only discovered two ways to get out of absurdity World Way number one you can
have all knowledge and if you had all knowledge you could never be wrong about something because you know it all and
the only way to know something and not be wrong about it in other words have absolute certainty is to know everything
or you have to know someone who knows everything and the one who knows everything can reveal knowledge to you
so the Christian claim is obviously we don't know everything the only way actually this would be
Christian or non-Christian the only way to have knowledge is if it's revealed by the one who knows
everything and cannot be wrong now that brings up multiple questions that goes along a whole line of thought
that I know we've kind of gone down before but the foundation the grounding
for any knowledge claim has to start with the one who knows
everything revealing truth to us so if we don't start there now now we're in absurdity world of I'm
absolutely sure that I don't have any absolutes I'm I I know that I don't know
anything for sure we end up in absurdity world and the only way out of absurdity world is
start with the one who knows everything revealing truth to us so that's my
Foundation is we have a foundation of I have to start with the one who knows everything
revealing truth to us so that we can know things otherwise and we all know
things you do know things Paul you know we're talking right now it's not a you're not wondering that you're not wondering if you're a brain and
a bat
you know you're here so I'd say everybody has knowledge and
um everybody knows uh things and that's impossible without the one who knows
everything revealing truth to us so that's my little argument so that actually is going to illustrate where I
hope we can get to morality maybe we'll never get there who knows um so you defined for me
uh what knowledge is and that is conforming or something conforming to the mind of
God something along that line right truth is so
um do you know this isn't meant to be like begging the question
is when is a logical fallacy when you assume the
conclusion in a premise right the problem is
the impossibility of the contrary if I don't start with God
now I'm in this weird world absurdity world of I know that I don't know
anything I'm sure that I'm not sure so say it again so let's just stick with
truth right now so you're you know again you're appealing to a lot of people's intuitions about knowledge and
intuitions about these kind of things but again they haven't most people including myself
haven't thought deeply about these things but when you think deeply about truth and you say well truth instead of I
usually used to would have held the truth is that which conforms the mind of God but if instead you define it as
truth is that which conforms to reality that is more that is an equal
intuition when you when you ask people about to Define reality they'll nod
their head at that as oh yeah intuitively I think that's what I'm talking about when I say truth when they
haven't thought about it I can I can kind of use that definition truth there is that which conforms to
reality to reality but you can't stop there as God sees it so just add as God sees
it because then you're still begging the question no I'm showing it's not begging the question to say that it's actually the
impossibility of the contrary because the argument I just gave so if you don't start with the one who knows everything
you can't have any knowledge no but you are begging the question because you are
if you want to test is does God exist you cannot start with the premise that includes God so I think you would agree
that if God is real the question does God exist is and turns
into very quickly an absurdity when you realize that without the one who knows everything I.E God you can't know
anything all right so so we need to shift knowledge it makes sense because I I understand you are using different
definitions than me but appealing to the same intuition that I have and the same intuition that people are listening to
you have and that's their intuition about reality intuition about knowledge knowledge
again if you're basing it on a definition that includes God then you then you have to say it your way however
if you present people as that knowledge is Justified true belief and that's what most of philosophy goes with that if you
explain that to people that also matches their intuition and then your but your conversation
about knowledge no longer holds up because in a Justified true belief situation my dog can know
that there is food in her dish but she's not necessarily confident
about that she's not necessarily have any epistemic um justification for it because
and you and then you throw in can you be wrong about anything you know and in terms justify true belief I can't be
wrong about anything I actually know because even if I have like only one percent confidence in it it's still
actually correct so there can't under under Justified true belief definition
nothing out in the universe can contradict something I know it can only contradict something I think I know
which is actually what you conflated you kind of did a bait and switch there you said can you be wrong with anything you
think you know and absolutely you can so that's so now you got an absolute so
it's absolutely true that you can be wrong about what you think you know so again the the problem is like
knowledge justifies under under just by true belief definition but you have to you have to Define true
and Truth is that which conforms to reality as God sees it well but then you've included if if God
is real you don't actually need that part right if God is real my definition of Truth
doesn't need that but again the idea that God is not the idea that the one who knows everything
does not exist leaves us in absurdity world so the very positing of the
question if God is real if the one who knows everything really does exist it's
absurd deposit that he doesn't exist because now we're stuck in the Absurd world if I don't know anything
but that's all fine because it's still a premise we can test if God is real we can still test it even if asking the
question is absurd well I think there's there's
this argument shows us that if you do not start with God all you can do is absurd talk all you have is absurdity I
know that I don't know uh I'm I can only have one percent uh certainty but I can
still be certain that's not certainty that's that's not what I said I can still know
it because knowledge is Justified true belief certainty doesn't come into the equation about knowledge that's where
that's where the difference lies so if you could be wrong about if you
could be wrong about something can you claim that you know that it's true can you call it knowledge if it could be
wrong you're saying yes I could be I the I'm gonna make a claim the moon classic
example the moon is made of green cheese but I could be wrong therefore do I know that the Moon is great made of green cheese no
because if you could be wrong
you don't know it that that's only that's that's your definition of knowledge but under Justified true
belief the knowledge is based on whether the claim is is true or not
and what is true and there's a there's another layer and what is what conforms to reality so is the moon made of cheese
does that conform to reality or not and a person could say no it's not made
of cheese and be be right and know that without justification and without
confidence they can still know it so you well the trouble is the only
difference you want to make this line but you want
to conflate thinking you know something and knowing something and those so can we can we know anything
Paul can we know anything to be absolutely certain because earlier you said no
I certainty this is where certainty and knowledge are not related
certainty and knowledge are not related in in in can I be can I be certain that
Elvis Presley is the current president of the United States can I be certain of that you could be very certain about that you
could be have confidence about that Galore is is can it can can my uh
is it true that Elvis Presley is the current president of the United States
it is not and you're absolutely sure of that you're certain of that no because
certainty doesn't play into it so you're not certain that Elvis Presley is not the current
president of the United States I am confident that Elvis Presley is not the president United States and I
believe that I know that but belief that I know that is not the same as knowing it
right so can we have certainty in anything no are you certain of that
no there's the problem we keep going down
I don't value certainty anymore you you value certainty in a way that I do not
but it and it's because and that is because honestly and I'm I'm we're friends so we're I'm I'm this
isn't like I gotcha thing that reveals foolishness it is like if you if I if I
took that clip out just now and put that up on Instagram as a real Christians would love it you know are you certain
of anything no you know can you have certainly you said no are you certain of that you're like no it's like
it's it I I don't know I I wish you could see the absurdity of that view of
that of that thinking because to and you have to do that and I get you because to deny the one who knows everything
you are left in foolish thinking that's all that's that's the only thing that's left is
foolishness at that point so I think what we've demonstrated though and this is where I hope to get with morality is
that we are because we are not using the same definitions for words like I will never use as my definition
of reality that which conforms to the mind of God as long as I don't believe in God
like I so as long as we will talk in circles this way and feel like the other person is being ridiculous
because we're not using the same definitions
that we think we are we intuitively understand and that's why the conversation has to
start with how do we know anything can we know anything can we have certainty is there any absolute truth is there
anything that is absolutely true there there is but we will but that's
unrelated to personal certainty and we know anything that is absolutely
true we we can but that is again we can't be
certain we might be so give me a give me a
what is something that is absolutely true
what is something that's absolutely true that I just that thought just ran through my head
is a thing that I can is that is absolutely true because the only according to Justified
Justified true belief I'm justified in thinking that because I the only thing I
can really be certain of is the content of my own thoughts but again you can have certainty now
about your own thoughts the that's the thing I can be most certain about when you're let's say it
that way yeah that sort of falls apart again like you you know can you be certain of anything you said no and now
you're arguing I can be you know you made the claim I could be certain about my own thoughts but then that goes
against your earlier claim so now you have to go well I can be mostly certain well this is part of the problem with the language about this is
that we we
use these colloquial phrases and that's how it's easy to trip people up in this
they do think about they do think about these their own maximum certainty as absolutely even if
there is a degree of certainty you know above that also people tend to
be overly certain about things like they can be 100 convinced of a thing
um well I I feel like you are using certainty and confidence uh as synonyms
no can we have absolute certainty and you would say no and I would ask are
you absolutely certain of that and you would have to say no and that means we can have absolute certainty that's a
contradiction oh but I said no we can't have certainty
right and then I said are you certain that we cannot have certainty and you're going to say no I'm not certain of that
that means therefore it is possible that we could have certainty it is possible absolutely and you could convince me you
could convince me that there's such a thing I would say a very statement we cannot have certainty
is in you're not you're having to dismiss it because it's it's
um it's an absurdity because to to stay consistent to hold your feet to stand on
your own foundation and be consistent you'd have to say I'm certain that I'm not certain of anything I know that I
don't have certainty and I at the same time I don't know it just it leaves you
in this absurdity world it leaves you in this in this world it doesn't make any sense it leads me in a world that is honest
and consistent with my definitions of these words and with philosopher's definitions these words that's why I'm going we keep pumping
heads because
consistent those those words have meaning that that
mean the exact opposite of what you're what you're claiming I can't have certain certainty honest consistent
those are those are based on like a having certainty and you're claiming assistance consistency does nothing to a
certain consistency is whether act whether proposition a and proposition B
are compatible that's that's consistency and honesty is about whether I am saying
the same things that I hold to be true like those are those are so those are not conflating things those are
different words of different I mean it's not it is not consistent to
say we cannot have certainty and I'm not certain of that
that's not that's that's not consistent
okay so intellectually honest is is different than honest that those are that's I'm just saying I think that when
people posit that I think I think either they are deluded into
into trying to hold these two views that don't go together in their mind uh I think it could be uh sometimes I think
it's it's self-delusion they don't want these things to be true so I think it could be a variety of things there but
anyway it that's where to have a conversation on morality we gotta we have to we have to have our conversation
based on can we find this can can we know what it is can we be certain about what these are or is this again just
flavors of ice cream and favorite candy bar and you're gonna tell me why you think kitkat's good and I'm gonna be
like no Reese's is good think about this flavor and it's like who cares then everybody gets to pick their own candy
bar let everybody be happy so in a way I'm actually with you on that
but uh well I'm not saying that that's yeah I'm saying that's your claim that's not mine no I understand no so but you
actually would want you're you're disparaging that view all right
and and and you're like I have no problem with that view like you're you're so you and I would have very different characterizations of whether
that view is a good one or not and because the definition of good is where
we we need to go eventually so let alone well that's where we have to found have a foundation of what truth
is so we it's it's hard to have even have this conversation and you've heard this before it's like okay Paul to have
this conversation of morality I'm gonna let you stand on the Bible and have this conversation and and just for sake of
the the show we'll move on but I'm going to let you stand here that we that there is certainty that there is even such a
thing as morality to have this conversation I mean the conversation assumes the morality exists
on on who can account for Morality where we're assuming something what is what is
morality then you know is anything absolutely right or wrong oh so I don't think so this is what this is your task
to convince me that something is wrong no put that on me man all right not
something that I'm responsible for and uh you know I I know that you I know you've done this before you
know you uh the Holy Spirit would be the eventually the person who would eventually if I become convinced would be the person
that does that I understand that's not your time I can yeah I cannot open the eyes of the blind no exactly so I so I
don't yeah that would be unfair to put that on you however yeah um
again I I feel like and this is where I was hoping that we could discover the fact that we disagree with morality
and yet we share some common intuition about morality is because we don't Define morality the same way
do do you have a definition of morality that you operate under
yeah I would say morality is um the nature and character of God
so when you whenever you talk about morality in all contexts what you are talking about is the the nature of God
the nature and the character of God yeah so to give an example why is lying
wrong God did not arbitrarily say you know I got an idea to make humans uh flourish
on Earth because I'm I'm giving them the command to to fill the Earth in order to do this you know what
I can see down the road if they lie to each other that's going to cause mistrust and boy that could man things
could go wrong if they do that so I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and start off by saying somewhere back here you know a couple thousand
years after I start
Humanity hey let's let's not do the lying thing that's not why God didn't decide to make lying wrong lying is
wrong is because God is not a liar stealing is wrong not because God said
oh well I want personal property rights and I want stealing is wrong because God is not a thief adultery he didn't look
down through the Echoes of time and go you know what ah if if they start you know enjoying each other's uh wives and
even people that aren't their wives and they they start having sex outside of marriage and stuff you know that could cause some relational
conflict no
adultery is wrong because God is perfectly faithful so there's a
grounding to why we have good and bad and that is in the nature and the character of God himself so we have to
ground things morally and it like for example if I if I took your answer to to
my to the question is anything absolutely right or wrong or wrong and you said no I'm like the conversation's
really over at that point isn't it I mean there's if there's there's there is no morality then
um if nothing is absolutely right or wrong well that's what but there is
but you would you would agree and you would appeal to normally that people have intuitions about what they think
morality is right like that's that's I would say that God has written his law
on every man's heart on every man's conscience yes a Biblical principle is God has written his law on every man's
heart everybody Romans chapter everybody knows right and wrong even those that didn't have the law all the way back
through time they they knew they understood uh uh morality because it's written on their heart yeah right yeah
so that's that's a way you can convince someone like me perhaps like that's an
appeal but we might I can't convince you of anything no no but but when you're if you're wanting to appeal to me to bring
me closer to your side you'd say hey Paul we we both share at least this
intuition about what's what we think is right and wrong right like that's a that's a bit of a common ground that you
might sometimes appeal to or so you would agree you would agree with me that
written on man's heart his his not not his there's not a physical writing on my
physical heart in here that we have a a somehow a non-material intuition not
made of the material world of things that are right and wrong you would agree with that
so yes I agree that we have an intuition about what's right and wrong and that is not Material in nature
well I feel like it comes from our thoughts and and thoughts are merely events and and so like they're based in
material so let's like let's not get there that's where it goes man you know
it this is this no but but the trouble is my intuition so but then I that's when I start to think to myself Paul
what do you mean when you Intuit that something is right and wrong
what and so for you right it sounds like right would be conforming to the Mind character of God
and something wrong would be something that is in conflict with the character of God is that fair
that'd be a simple way to yeah I don't even mind you can go to the dictionary I even brought and now the dictionary has
changed uh the meanings of different words over time I brought my uh 1891 dictionary here what they what they uh
they used to say but uh but yeah I mean right is that which uh comports with the character of God wrong is that which
goes against the character of God I mean I don't even mind dictionary definitions you know of morally good because again
we're getting down to what is morality Justified what is acceptable what is morally correct or honorable those those
ideas still stem from a an absolute SIM from a something that is not subjective
it's not flavors of candy bars it's not um it's not flavors of ice cream it's not favorite colors it's some kind of
standard yeah do humans have intuitions about non-moral things
such as I don't know do we have any like do we have intuitions that we should eat
food do we have intuitions that were that we should drink water do we have intuitions
about anything um would you call those intuitions about
eating food and drinking water I don't know if I'd call those intuitions um well that's why I didn't want to like
do you think there's anything in the same class of our intuition is about morality about us
that is that is written on our heart I'd say it's written on our heart that that God exists we know that
um all we can do is suppress that truth I'd say it's written on our again the the okay
love your enemy and said hey hate your enemy would be a you know an intuition that's written or excuse me uh um love
people would be something that we know we should do we don't always do it we disobey our own conscience I think
that's a category of morality so I'll I guess abandon that so when I'm healing when
I'm feeling well I think those other things are intuitions right they're things that we innately
do and we do with shorthands we do with heuristics we're not thinking about breathing we're not thinking so when
we're underwater right like we intuitively our bodies you know go for air our bodies
um and I feel like morality is in that same category because
when when I when I think about right and wrong I think about just just something harm
someone I think about the second commandment never the first I love their neighbors
yourself so I when I think of something right I think about that something that is affirming others and that is uh
reducing harm and when I think about something as being bad I think about that as causing harm or or reducing uh
pleasure reduce not uh you know well-being not pleasure so much but well-being
in in that Realm my instincts the the the Christian has a
have Christians have appealed to with me in the past those actually those intuitions make
equal sense under that framework and under that framework
then I'm defining morality as the second commandment essentially that
which doesn't you know that which uh helps my fellow human flourish and which
reduces harm and increases well-being I know that we are where the imperfection
comes obviously is our ability to predict how those things are and the competition and you would call this sin
nature but I would just call it you know our self-preservation versus group preservation
um if we're I don't need you to greet that definition at all but I guess I'm just
wondering is it does it make any sense to you that that for
it is a world view that is coherent
uh and consistent with these intuitions or do you think or you
think no I even made a sign for this Paul cool
says who who had the meeting that decided this
when was the meeting and why wasn't I invited like said you know what so when you think about whether something when
you think about whether something's right or wrong and when I think about whether something's right or wrong you
have in your head a bit of the notion of this like something that the Bible wouldn't speak on directly so you know
is AI good or bad what's that it gave us all the principles that we need biblically it
did and God wrote that on our heart yeah ABS absolutely okay it's hard for me I can't even get off
that because deposit anything other than that is we get into this absurdity world now where it's it's arbitrary I mean
like like again I just I would hold this up and say so it's like that's arbitrary who who cares what you think morality is
Paul well because if if the appeal if the appeal is and maybe you're not making
this appeal but people try to convert me and others by
appeal by appealing to our common Instinct about what morality is and what
you what they would tell me is what's written on my heart and if if you're trying to and they're
trying to say that is written in your heart is evidence of a god right
um or at least I shouldn't ask you to confirm what other people tell me because that's not fair but when people
are trying to convert me and convince me that they use a moral argument for God
if there are other things that explain my intuitions in an equal way
it no longer is a argument for God and so I guess maybe you don't make this
argument for God yeah you can't even say equal way because you're dealing with a complete
you're dealing with a complete again it's an arbitrary it's an absurdity it's
a flavor versus an absolute so you can't say it's equal then nothing equals that
that's the problem there is no equal to the absolute the one who knows everything you can't you can't get above
that you can't get around that you can't get by that you can't there's no way to go I'm going to take my arbitrary
opinion and I'm just going to sit here and go says who who cares I mean I it doesn't matter what you think it's it's
irrelevant if you don't have an objective standard if you don't if you're not basing it on an absolute
nothing is equal to an absolute but so if I had thought to make a sign
my sign would say who cares if there's I almost played that one for you because I
made I made one that says why as well because that's the other question that keeps coming up well why why why is that the standard why
why did you pick that
as the standard why why why and then the next question was says who well and then that is who cares
um like I am I am because I am unconvinced that there is an absolute
and I what I need to do is someone who attempts to be intellectually honest and
this is what I'm trying to have this conversation to to get some pushback is am I am I missing something am I am I doing
this wrong are there facts about are there facts about the universe that I can test
with using predictive power that would inform me that absolute morality is anything
different than just intuition and yeah and a desire for it to be that way you're denying the creator of it all
you're denying the one who made it all you're denying and and that's where I'd say you know you you really
is it denying or is it testing is it is it denying or is it just seeking affirmation of
no you you are actively denying I mean watch your videos go back and watch them you're actively denying God you're not
just contesting it you're not just saying I'm not sure you're actively denying him and and it makes sense
because those who are not regenerated are the Bible says at enmity with God it's not just that you're wondering if
God exists it's like God says no you're actively fighting against me and I'd say anybody that watches your channel would
say boy it sure seems like Paul is actively fighting against God this is not a I'm in a search to find seems like
no this is an act of fighting against and that's again what scripture says those are not for me or against me it's not like there is no neutral
ground
there's no there's no I'm going to be I'm neutral on this one is there such a thing is there such a thing as a
hypothetical person whose faith is in God and yet still wants to maybe test whether these things are true or or the
second you start to test it you fall a note of that category well again I what does scriptures say
lean not on your own understanding and all your ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths so I'm going to take every thought
captive and make it
obedient to Christ as a Christian I'm going to do what I believe I'm gonna I'm
gonna submit my thinking I mean because this is the sin in the Garden of Eden Satan said you know God said this Satan
said this and he was like let me decide and that's that's the same thing I mean you're my friend that's the same thing
you're falling for Paul you're calling for the same lie of I'm going to be the Arbiter I mean and and this gets into if
I if I go okay let's not Grant the Christian worldview let's stand strictly on the materialistic atheistic worldview
now we've got a whole bunch of problems because you're right my intuitions or my thoughts are just chemical reactions
those aren't right or wrong the words right and wrong don't apply to chemical
reactions you can't even they make no sense well eventually if under my definition of
right or wrong they can but that's fine so can I do this I do have a slide on a
series of slots can I so you gave your definition of morality as an atheist um and it was uh right is that which
doesn't harm um and bad is what causes harms right is uh something about helping encourages
human flourishing so yeah so yeah now there's lots of there's lots of problems with that we could say okay let's grab
that let's look at the problems but let me first go okay let me pull up there's an uh a guy who was an atheist let me go
to this slide real quick um and now you'll have to forgive me this
is a long quote but let me uh let me let me read this quote okay he had just told the story of
he had just told the story of attempting to murder his father with a ball-peen hammer while his father was sleeping and
he says this did I mention that I was an atheist I understand that most of you atheists
out there live perfectly normal lives but I can never understand why you would
want to think about it we've got this massive universe and over here is a tiny little
crumb of a galaxy out of one of the Spiral arms of this galaxy is a
thoroughly unremarkable ball of hot gas circling this ball of hot gas is a
pathetic Speck of cosmic dust we call Earth and crawling all over the Earth
are these feeble selfish self-destructive lumps of cells
consistently diluting themselves into thinking that what they do is so important but the universe couldn't
conceivably care less whether you love your neighbor as yourself or tortures
them to death for fun so you might as well do whatever you feel like doing with a little bit of
time you've got and what are my atheist friends doing going to do with their 80
years or so let me guess you're going to go to school for a while then get a job work for a few decades maybe pick up a
family along the way then retire and die of old age or some illness
how original free thinkers huh believe it or not some people don't want to live
like cattle some people don't want to follow this pattern that we're all expected to mindlessly follow some would
rather bash a man's head in or shoot up a theater or walk down their school hallways stabbing people and why
shouldn't they because it's wrong says who your grandma
or should they try not to hurt people because people have intrinsic value here I thought human beings are nothing but
machines for propagating DNA most people don't want to kill and Slaughter but for those who do our
civilization is rapidly destroying any significant reason they might have or resisting the urge to kill and Slaughter
young people are lining up to dance to the music of their DNA all you can do
now is hope that they get tackled when they stop to reload or that they make some huge blunder when their bloodbath
begins I made a huge blunder when my bloodbath began I underestimated the amount of damage a human head could
endure crushed skulls can apparently be pieced Back Together by doctors my dad had brain damage but he survived the
attack I was taken to a mental hospital and later to jail Jail's a place to sit
back and reflect on the things you've done you've got plenty of time to sit back and think why did I get caught what
steps can I take to avoid getting caught next time and without all the empty repetitive tasks that ordinarily keep you mentally
sedated you've got plenty of time to figure out what's important to you the
most important thing to me was not being a slave to people from whom I had nothing but contempt but people had
controlled me in various ways throughout my life and this meant that they would need to be taught a lesson I had a list
of people going back to kindergarten who are going to be brutally murdered
and I go Paul why can't that be the foundation if it's just ice cream
flavors he happens to like Rocky Road yep nothing wrong with that yep so
I love David wood David wood uh he is his family and his story is very
inspiring I think you know a little bit you must know a little bit about him if you've put put that up there
um David wood as you know though has been this is not said to be disparaging
in any way because he talks about it all the time he's been diagnosed with socio sociopathy
and so his his brain chemistry is definitely
operating you know when you talk about fizzing and whatever um in a way that is
not not atypical that's the word I'm looking for so would you say not good or
maybe that's the evolution that maybe we need to allow his genes to propagate the society maybe that's actually the next
evolutionary step granting the evolution there you go so that you actually are leading to exactly where I would go is
that um the basis the the basis why my
definition for Morality works is that as a social species we actually do correct
for for behavior that counters against the group in the short term individuals
can and will do certain things that are counter to group well-being
but over the long term we come together
uh any social species not just Humanity comes together to to rein in and limit
um this kind of behavior like someone someone like that someone who's going to be caught
always selfish will not have as many kids uh you know you might point to well
Genghis Khan acted that way and he actually has more kids than anyone in the whole world um yes but his Reign was put to his Reign
was put to an end uh and and so you know I feel like the evolution that
doesn't mean what he was doing was wrong and that's called what you're doing is the naturalistic fallacy again simply hold up my sign says
who who but I said
it's wrong according to um it's it's only wrong if you define
definition wrong the way I did and the only thing keeping that definition in
check is survival and we don't we can absolutely ignore it but then our
species will go extinct and any species any social species that ignores it
uh explain that to me it's uh the fallacy it's an informal logical fallacy if something is natural
it must be good and it's kind of closely related to the is ought fallacy no because I don't think that's what I was
saying it ought to be the case that it survives but that's not that's not what I said I
didn't say it was I hope it's not what I said you you've now given me something to think about
um I hope that's not what I said when I said it doesn't it's not good or bad whether the species goes extinct the
universe cares not whether Humanity survives or not but it's just a fact of reality that in
order to if if we want to survive that's then then this is the way we need
to go and you just did it you just did it you said what is the case and then it
it and implied that it ought to be the case that we ought to survive it is the case is ought fallacy let me let me uh
let me make sure I'm being clear so if we want to survive then we ought to do this the but there's
no obligation to want to survive so now it's arbitrary again now we don't have anything else I do think it's arbitrary
yeah and there were there definitely would have been species that didn't value survival or the hypothetically
it's very it's it's incredible entirely possible that there were species that didn't value survival and it makes
logical sense that such a species would wouldn't survive right wouldn't last
which yeah you don't get good and bad from that though you can't no you still can't use these so you still can't use
the words good and bad at all let's talk about the word ought in general I don't think there can be the word
ought applies to anything without a conditional if that we agree to First and ought not
correct ought implying what you should do ought not implying what you shouldn't do right and so
so if you want to if you want to win them nothing if if you want to win the race you should run fast
but if you don't care about winning the race then there is no ought at all
and if they're okay and if they're yeah so you're making the point if there is no ultimate our species should survive
ought to survive there you cannot there is no oughts you shouldn't do these
things and there's no ought Notch you shouldn't not do these things raping and what the transgender
lady did in Tennessee of shooting and killing six people three nine-year-olds
and three adults that's just what she did I mean there's no uh she's sure there's no ought not
because that's what she wanted to do there's no Universal lot not the universe doesn't care that that happened
but humans care if humans flourish so who cares humans the humans that care
will care and the humans that don't care won't care
yeah who cares who cares and who doesn't care it doesn't matter uh the universe doesn't yeah that makes
the conversation irrelevant that makes this entire conversation irrelevant because what you're doing is going how
do I get more people to care about human flourishing even though human human flourishing doesn't really matter but it
matters to me therefore my DNA is going to try to make people care about human flourishing that's actually not my uh
that's not my goals is to make someone care my my question was are the
intuitions that seem to overlap among humans does that is
that only explained with God or are there other explanations that are equally plausible or at least
consistent with the evidence if maybe maybe they have you might say they have less explanatory power or there's some
others uh circumstance um oops I accidentally that was
not intended there um let me let me play for you I want to
quickly Play a clip of you and just hope wondering if you how you feel about it
uh in the light of the time are you comfortable with that I have a feeling that based on the chord
I just read I'll be just fine with my uh with my statement
uh podcast with a couple atheists and they asked me they said Eric if you were not a Christian would that would that
let you just do anything you want to do I said it's not the same shirt is it you're not wearing either you've got a
new version of this shirt yeah I think that's a is that a black one but no this is a newer shirt thank you that was that was a several years ago so
I have a
closet of 30 of the same shirts so I yeah you wait buddy when when you get socks that
are older than your kids you're just like wow absolutely I
absolutely no restraints at all I would do whatever I want and that's where we
get lots of you guys get lots of testimonies I'd be in jail if I wasn't a Christian I'd be breaking out of jail if
I wasn't a Christian I would have gotten to counterfeiting so I assume that's still kind of where
you sit in your life or do you or do you or would you revise that a little bit no I think what David Woods said Echoes it
as well like it doesn't make sense I mean I would try not to get caught but
if there is no standard if there's no why not defraud people why not build a
pyramid screen scheme and use my charismatic personality to try to to try to win people over and actually fleece
the money out of them and not get and try not to get caught there's no reason not to like why not
okay do you accept that there are plenty of people who don't
rely on the same God that or actively suppress God let me phrase it that way there are lots of people actively
suppress God and yet don't do those things
well when you understand that morality is the character and nature of God and the part of the character and nature of
God is to glorify himself nobody can be unless what we're doing is for the glory
of God it cannot be moral that's why I say sometimes not only do we need to be saved from our bad works the battle
we've done we need to be saved from our good works because we think that we can be pretty good without God and God says
no your your good stuff is as filthy rags to me I don't care if you helped an
old woman across the street if you're not doing that for my glory it's not it's not done even in the right way so
so you can't even have morality apart from the god of the Bible
so but you do you feel like really if if You Were Somehow to become
convinced that God doesn't likely exist tomorrow
but that you would go on some kind of
stealing Killing Spree like you you honestly feel like you would be that unrestrained I don't know that killing
would be my my Mo but if my DNA you know was a serial killer DNA well then I'm
just dancing to my DNA you know if and that's why you can't like you can't you can't blame the shooters you can't blame
people because they're just dancing to their DNA they're just doing what what Nature has has I can't even use the word
created has has can't use the word curse nature isn't a thing it just it's it's what the material world has done there's
no right and wrong so um I think I've said it before there's a
clip out there I I probably would have grown up um and I was being a little sarcastic when I said it but I would probably
still be just uh trying to see how many women I can get with uh looking at lots
of porn and trying to gratify the flesh all I can because in and of me there is
no good thing and I I would simply I'd simply be trying to gratify My Flesh
which oh you know I'm not gonna yeah that's fine okay so that is where you stand you
would agree that that's okay right uh to the extent where you are not harming other people that is okay yeah so me me
having a bunch of wives it's not hurting them it's all consensual me having wives
of varying ages doesn't matter how old they are as long as it's consensual well
consent uh Within like there are
there are ages of cons like you you can't I don't I don't think that they're and I don't we would equivalent what the
age ideas but there's a consent there is a line under which consent cannot be given so
well can so this is great so consent consent is a matter of
uh there's a power dynamic between adults and kids and and within a so I there's I would
say there's also outside of just consent is when you say freely given
means that there is not a an after a course a course of uh Power Dynamic difference
there and between adults and kids they're they're just always is and
that's arbitrary isn't it no they well why is that wrong just be I mean because
why is it wrong just because it's doing somebody the variability for me to charm a woman into going to bed with me is you
could call that power over you know to create that consensual relationship so
you can't you still can't come down with the right and wrong you can't get enough you can't say oh no I'm not you can't in
this conversation that's what I'm saying I don't think there is enough I've yet to be convinced that there is a knot other than that yeah there's
not an or
not there's not a not not but if we care about if we care about the same goal then then there are odds
arbitrary goal who cares that's right but if we both end up but
in these in in in Morality people tend to actually share
the goal I can't have a moral conversation with someone who doesn't care about human flourishing and who
doesn't have a more conversation period because there's no odd and ought not there is no
morality Arts you'd have to demonstrate for me that there can be odds
I that are isolated from ifs and I you haven't demonstrated that for me and no
one's demonstrated I'm trying to put that on you no one has demonstrated for me that and they got in any circumstance
can exist without an arbitrarily selected if well again now we're now we're dealing
with with how to know what truth is and how can we have truth without the one who knows everything and so we get back
to that foundational thing because because you're saying I want proof that this is true
you you've kind of already said we can't know what that is we can't
can't really have an absolute we can't so you're asking for something while denying its existence in the first place
it wouldn't even make sense for me to try to to do that so preponderance of evidence doesn't
need to land on certainty preponderance of evidence just needs to be demonstrable and and it seems like if
God was real that God could operate in those in the in that parameters of demonstrating that that he was real so
but God has absolutely demonstrated in those parameters and there's no question
about that and that very statement demonstrability you would say well I'm
not demonstrable about that I'm not certain of that I'm not it doesn't really have to be that way I'm asking
for it to be demonstrable evidence while at the same time nothing's again the language itself denies
your your your foundation the language itself is what I'm
attempting to Wade through and now the this has been a helpful conversation for
me um and I think again I I think that perhaps the audience will agree and you
guys can let me know in the chat let me know in the comments have we have Derek and I butted against
definitional problems where because we couldn't agree with definitions uh we're just no we haven't been talking past
each other so yeah but it's not definitional problem Paul it's not so for somebody to say yeah it sounds like
it's just they Define things differently no it's do we have a found do we have an absolute to ground a definition in so
it's not a do we Define things differently it's is there an absolute to ground things in yeah that's a good
question I should hear from this conversation is well Paul is saying there's no absolute to
ground things in it's all vanilla and and chocolate Eric is saying there is an absolute even
if you're an atheist you should say Eric is grounding it in the absolute character and nature of God the God who
cannot change the god of the Bible so he has an absolute whether I agree with it or not he has an absolute the other side
has no absolute that's like what we should see from this would you agree with that statement
not really uh in uh for some reasons we've gone into also uh the the word of
God is I I would agree that there if the word of God is the word of God that there is
a singular way to interpret it but there's a right way there's a right
way there's a way that if if it's the word of God there's a way that God intended people is that a good way to
say it there's a way that God intended us to do and some people get it wrong yes and
and that just that way out
the fact that we do need to interpret it actually should and in its own way soften some of the the absolutes that
you you put on that but that's okay I feel like no because a car manufacturer cannot help if somebody decides to read
it and they say put four and a half quarts of oil and they say you know I'm going to interpret that as 12. you know I
that's all middle that's not on the car manufacturer right now it's not I'm not saying it's on God I'm just saying like
let's say we have two people who are like disputing like they have they have the car manual right in front of them
but they both interpret differently um how that is to be instructed I don't
think either of the people in that dispute should should feel incredibly certain even though there is a way that
it was intended to be to be interpreted uh oh yeah I think I think if you and I
were reading and it said four chords and and very clearly it had the the word for with the parentheses four and somehow
you interpret it I let's say I did I was on misinterpreting it as eight no that means that means I need I need four of
these gallons and you're like no this is quartz no I'm doing four gallons it there is somebody who's absolutely right
and and they could hold to it as I I could I you could claim absolutely no I am right
about that now I don't claim that about everything I think about the Bible but there are some things that we can be absolutely sure of and it
sure beats the
other side which is I cannot be absolutely sure of anything um and you know what I think
I I would I would concede this point too there are certain things that the Bible like if anyone says I interpret the
Bible to say that God doesn't exist well that's just a ridiculous application that's that's a foreign
but there are there are certainly uh things in the Bible that require some interpretation but I love it when you
use the word certainly yes all right do you have time to let's let's go to
some questions for the audience if you have time what have they been saying I'm kind of curious who's uh I I don't know
I try not to pay attention to the chat too much because I want to be focused on the conversation but let's see what the
uh the question askers have been throwing up there so Brian Stevens for uh two dollars says didn't he just
say I wasn't saved until 18. so I don't 20 23.
like you you actually have a hole and I actually had prepared I had prepared a little bit of from that
speech if we we're going to have time uh we don't but uh but your your consistent
in saying that that you you said like me you believed you were a
Christian yeah but but you I would phrase it I was
the product of a Christian environment rather than a disciple of Jesus Christ so I had been raised in the church and I
and I I this is probably one of my biggest concerns with the church today is how many people are raised in the
church and they have Mom and Dad's Faith they don't have their own they don't have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that is a big big
problem in the
church today and I think a lot of people that now would watch you and be like wow Paul finally I found somebody that to me
makes sense even though you know um they would go I I grew up in the church very much the same and now you
know now I don't believe that uh and I go um I'm I'm glad you now know you don't
have a relationship with Jesus Christ and I hope that God opens your eyes to the reality that you need one you know I
I pray for you guys I say all the time how much I love atheists but I mean talking to Paul here I love Paul I
genuinely love I I had lunch with him at Mensa uh the friendly atheist in Chicago I love I'm like I love you guys I it's
it's genuine it's not I there's no I'm not trying to build a platform on this
I'm not doing YouTubes back and forth with you guys it's just I love you I'm glad you know where you stand before God
and I'd love for you to I'd love for God to open your eyes and Grant you repentance leading to the knowledge of
the truth so I'm I'm I I genuinely pray for that and yeah so that that wasn't a country
Eric wasn't contradicting himself when he said I wasn't safe to 18. um Terence Clark five dollars thank you
knowledge is not an endpoint on the spectrum of confidence uh I think that would be my I would I
would agree with that and
if you don't have the one who knows everything you're stuck in the Absurd position of I can't really know anything
but anyway okay all right um only as if deals and absolutes well
that was that was my former boss wrote that is that absolutely true or is he being absolute about that you Sith you
that's right only you're right it's true to be internally consistent only a Sith could say that there you go yeah uh
Brian Stevens for two dollars I've heard the same script from Screech preachers um probably true
I I'd say man I I encourage you to not just because it's real easy most of the
times what we do is we try to defend where we're at I'm I'm going to call myself an atheist and now I got to
defend that so we're looking at everything is how do I punch against it rather than taking it in and saying
wait a minute wow this this logically makes sense I have to start with absurdity
or I I have to conclude absurdity or I have to start with God so I have two choices here God the one who knows
everything so that we can have truth he's revealed it to us or this absurd position that I could be wrong about everything which means I don't
know
anything that's an absurdity so it's either God or absurdity though it's interesting in telling to me when I said you know if you came to believe
that God
didn't exist tomorrow and you just said that couldn't happen um yeah it's only the contrary I think
that in this way you've put yourself into a similar situation that perhaps and I'm trying to defend myself against
but maybe you're right maybe I am in this situation where I am watching you sound it's a logically sound position in
other words to deny that now I'm logically unsound so it's it's like it's the only option available it's not that
I'm saying I'm I'm convincing myself of this it's going if I if this isn't true if there isn't somebody who knows
everything if God who knows everything didn't reveal truth to us if Revelation Revelation is our only out of absurdity
so it's either God or it's absurdity but what you're saying Eric is that if
let's let's just hypothetically say there was a flaw in your thinking there it sounds like you are you are not open
to hearing it well I would say
no I I'd I'd be open but I'd say I it has been revealed not just to me to
everybody that this is true the one of the things that he has revealed is that he exists and so this has been revealed
that it's true so it'd be it's again it's two different foundations it's two different starting points fair
enough um so I think this is a very similar message a
note from Terence knowledge is not a measure of confidence neither is Truth uh I would agree with that but Eric and
I think we both because we don't agree on what the definition of knowledge or truth are then we're not going to agree on that so
that's fair um Mark writes is the Bible moral and it's teaching about how to keep and
treat slaves or is it immoral spoiler alert all slavery well okay absolutely
all slavery is 100 immoral absolutely so uh I don't necessarily agree with this
but we're against what Paul believes yeah so what do you just why not like I
go if if this if Mark is an atheist and if he's he's certainly not holding your
position Paul because he's making an ought and ought not there ought not be
slavery and I would say well Mark do you have any credit card debt you are a
slave to that person who loaned you the money the borrower is slave is servant to the lender and I did a whole show on
uh on biblical slavery on my website if you want the full answer no absolutely
the chattel slavery that we practice here in North America which was practice way more in in European countries and
practiced by uh by the Islamic World heavily uh you I don't know what you
think about this for somebody to make a claim like that they're really ignorant of history and ignorant of the Bible so I you can look at that so
this would if
this was to be a topic that that like people would sincerely discuss and and YouTube chat doesn't lend itself to it
so that it's free for you would first need to say let's define slavery let's
let's get on the same page about what slavery means because uh perhaps if you
said oh Mark only counts this activity of slavery you might agree with him but but you might say that the Bible
that's not what the Bible says when it means slavery so therefore we don't agree like it's just this is uh this
opens itself up to a huge definition and again it gets down to I I do I debate for somebody who does not agree with the
Bible do I debate the truth of what the Bible is actually saying it's like you don't even this is irrelevant to you it
doesn't even matter right and you know you're you're you're standing on an absolute Foundation while I would say if
I go through my without the one who knows everything you can't know anything Revelation you're probably he's probably
Mark is probably sitting in the seat of the Absurd saying I can't really know anything and then at the same time claiming absolute certainty
and stuff
like that so I think yeah I think what marker I would want to our intuition
would we would want to say we would want to debate does slavery cause harm and God doesn't even need to be involved in
a does slavery cause harm um discussion right you can you could discuss that one way or the other but
but you're conflating two different conversations so um Eric if you can only ground knowledge in the one who knows everything how do
you know you're talking to the one who knows everything if he didn't reveal himself to everybody we couldn't know anything so it's again
the impossibility we call it the impossibility of the contrary because the the other option is absurdity so the
other option is an impossibility so we have to go with this and it's it's like it's a one-way Street and there's no way
out of it you're forced logically down this road of do you want absurdity I can't know anything or do you want the
one who knows everything is revealed true to us those are our only two options um or Can You observe where you define
absurdity as living with uncertainty it seems like but no because I live I have
lots of things that God has not revealed absolutely to me so it's not that everything I believe is absolute but
there are things that he has revealed that are absolute so you know and we
didn't even get into like I I should have made the signs about this the the very concept of laws of morality
um again on the basis of they are absolute which you're not even there but on the basis of their absolute
um laws of morality laws of logic laws of math laws of science they are immaterial in nature they're not made
out of matter they are Universal they apply everywhere and they are unchanging
the laws are you can so I I don't use this to say well therefore
God exists the argument is actually backwards if the universal immaterial unchanging God of the Bible did not
exist you could not have Universal immature or unchanging laws of logic science math and morality and that gets
deeper but it's a it's a good way to understand I have to have the right
starting point to get what I see in the world today it has to start with God in order to get what we see today so I'm
not arguing Upstream to the conclusion of God I'm saying I have to start here to get that and and yeah and very much
the opposite those those things you described are properties of a universe and it makes sense that they're
Universal because that's the property of the universe and we have discovered properties about the universe when we call them laws because
we haven't seen
exceptions yet so just the flip side uh Hillel writes
could Claire please explain why he thinks knowledge bracket certainty about a belief is more important than the if
whether the belief is well Justified or well supported I don't know if that certainty
is more important than if the belief is well we'll just divide and support it is
the same thing as like certainty so
could Eric explain why you think certainty more important well Justified support I mean that's
so I actually says it sounded like for me to the conversation that you treated
those differently certainty meaning your psychological state of how confident you can be
uh so I guess what you're trying to say now is those are not separate things like my confidence in a proposition
doesn't necessarily need to be related to the amount of evidence I have for it
and so it sounded it sounded sometimes at points in the conversation where you thought those were separate things how
confident you can be in it and how much evidence I have for it um
um so there are not there are many things that
I am not certain about that I could be wrong about many many many things okay
lots of things um but there are things that I can be certain about
and if you don't start with the one who knows everything revealing truth to you you can't be certain about anything
and to me that's what was demonstrated is we either start with an absolute the one
who knows everything or we're standing on this world view of we could be wrong about everything there is no certainty
it doesn't matter how much well Justified well-supported information you have you cannot have any certainty and
I'm not I would reject that we cannot have certainty because that's a certainty claim
fair enough I think for Hill and others like yeah we just don't we only we don't
actually care about certainty we just care about predictive power and we're willing to completely throw out our if predictive power fails we're
willing to
throw things out but that's we've been been around this horn so we'll we'll just keep moving um morality is a
conversation not a noun um uh I think people don't like it I I have
a thing that I don't like people using evil as a noun it's it bristles me
um I feel like evil is a descriptor of like you need to have a subject like the
Evil's not wandering around even if you want to say Satan is evil well that was you know that's an evil being and
there's a anyway fair enough I think they're poking fun at a thing that I bristle about
so morality is a conversation not a noun I I I again I don't know how you how you
bristle about it but I'm going I I evil you've heard the idea that evil is
not a thing it's the lack of something it's the lack of good just like heat is not a thing it's the lack of cold or a
cold is not a thing it's the lack of heat so I'm right but also I but I I would actually say heat isn't a thing
either right like heat is heat is uh like heat's not a noun either per se
like in terms of it's not a thing like heat just heat is the this chemical is a
temperature change uh it you know that kind of thing anyway evil I don't know if you would think
that evil in and of itself or even good is a noun like you you would actually
agree with me like you say good is is grounded in us in God's nature like it's
just there's a subject that exists that is good and that's what makes that's how good exists
virtuous it's applying to the actions of yeah somebody that right yeah conform to
the character of God you actually agree with the good good doesn't exist without a subject I guess is uh to you and I
agree in its own way uh with plethory's 3 15 watching and double digit and double oh
so he's he's using YouTube things 315 people were watching us I guess at some point and there's only uh 99 people or
however many that clicked on the thumbs up I don't really care if you click on the thumbs up but that's great uh at least I like and if you didn't
like it
click the thumbs down I'm cool with that too um and at least I like these kind of conversations educational far nicer than
debates yeah I think Eric and I are both in the camp that um straight on formal debates have are more theater than truth
um and that that that's not either Eric ori's strength is is formal debates and so we're better in conversational modes
Eric's better than I am in conversation modes but uh because he's more practice always no I've you and I have always had
great conversations oh we've had uh because you make me comfortable and actually I thank you for that but there are not everyone makes
me feel
comfortable and so I'm not always as good Europe come down and hang out in Pensacola that's gonna happen what are
you waiting for do I need to buy the ticket for you too no no no no no no no no do we need to do a fundraiser right
here on YouTube no it's it's uh my Shannon's a silly job is his uh is you know holding us up at
the moment but no we'll get there we'll get there okay uh and actually we if it ever comes down to though that
there's like Ben has talked with me about this before like if there ever is a thing like let's have Paul come down and we're going to
talk in front of some schools or talk in front of this stuff like if it's a business trip we can make that happen
almost any time let's figure that out well we could just have a conversation about YouTube and call it a business trip baby let's talk it out yeah
yeah
that's right cool cool uh so hello writes hypothetically if God in his mysterious ways told Eric to lie and
steal from his neighbor and assured him that that was an Act was consistent with his nature would Eric go with it thanks
hmm how would you answer that I'm going I mean he it's he wouldn't tell me to do
something against his nature so now I I I I I could I could see God saying
like if I was hiding Jews from during the Holocaust and God said it's okay to
lie about that I would lie about that yeah I think it would have to be if I was to answer this even in my old
Christian mode like God God would have to again I think that would be part of
assuring me that it was part of a larger plan that at this moment a piece of information needed to be hidden from an
enemy or that or that they took like uh would it be okay if someone still
if an enemy had come and taken the Ark of the Covenant were the with the Jews have been Justified to go get that back like
absolutely they would have and so um if you steal it back is it actually
stealing well and that's and that's the that's the question and so um and and I think I think justifiably so if
in the Christian worldview of God I was asking you to steal something like everything belongs to him ultimately so
that would be like to God can God steal something like that I don't think God could steal something
right because everything forgets why it belongs to him that's a great Point yeah
all right there's my Chris I need I need an actual Christian hat sometimes I can put on I
have an atheist hat so with the students up there before I have you talk to him and I always have fun
with that all right uh only someone truly insecure about his beliefs before debate makes props beforehand I don't
agree with that that's why I got a question for you
I got a question for you Phil that is that it was no actually it's a demonstration of um like so I
have in the past if you think that's a primary I mean I've made slides in the past in a debate setting knowing that
someone or assuming that someone was going to go down a certain path and I had slides prepared for that I
think that's a sign is nothing different than than having an argument I disagree
all right thanks 9.99 yeah you're wrong we'll use that for uh to take Eric for
coffee when we go hang out uh we just got a couple more uh every tiny living
thing judges right from wrong for it to animals can place behaviors in those boxes social animals can judge the
behavior of others but uh but what you're probably what your behavior goes
into which box is taught hmm I don't know if I agree with that
I think I think it's it's learned a lot I think again if it's the if it's the moral nature okay again if we go on the
it's the it's the character of God you got one answer if it's it's not on the character of God it's arbitrary it's
vanilla versus chocolate it's Reese's versus KitKat well then who cares what
what box you check and what you what you decide why why not beat your dad's brains in with a ball peen hammer so I
guess it doesn't yeah if we want to be just play with this mentally if if one was to say that right and wrong is
literally just labels we give to preferences if that was the label if that's how you're defining right or wrong is
preference labels uh then he's probably correct then every every living thing has preferences
and they act toward those preferences I guess that's fair but you can't call it right or wrong well this is you can't
you cannot give the label right wrong good bad ought not none of those labels would apply to the preferences then well
that's good yeah that's a label fight and I think that people inadvertently and you probably agree people do
use right and wrong as if they are you say they wrongly do this but people
in in practice do use those words to mean preferences sometimes well and I think I think most of the
time they use those words in line with the moral nature and character of God
even though they want while denying it at the same time again it gets back to that absurd world view
uh Jeff Cochran writes your thoughts are just electrochemical events knowledge is not absolute certainty morality is a
biological predisposition I'm sorry if this upsets anyone sometimes the truth is upsetting
he said he said knowledge is not absolutely certain and then used truth is upsetting that's funny it's a
contradiction right there in the very statement itself you like you literally contradict yourself in that sentence
that's on the screen right now so that's knowledge is not ABS that that can can
we have absolute certainty the truth the truth assumes certainty truth is truth
assumes certainty if it's true it's certainly true
um so and this is where with my with my secular Brethren and I demonstrated it
several times here because we are imprecise with our language uh we open ourselves up to these kind of criticisms
so uh being more precise with our language would be helpful for myself and
for my brethren so and but go back to that one real quick morality is not
uh morality is a biological predisposition well then your net so you
cannot say to the child rapist who that is his biological predisposition that is
his morality you cannot claim that it's wrong you can say we don't like it and
therefore we're going to put you in this little bitty cage for a long time because we didn't like what you did but you can't say it was wrong
so well you can yeah so again because we're not defining right and wrong the
same way um we can't use Eric's definition of wrong for it we can use our definition of wrong for it which is subjective
which is arbitrary right but subjectively it is yeah wrong so yeah can you be certain God exists if
the only way to be certain is to ask God hmm yeah again yes you can have certainty
because the the opposite of that is absurdity yes you
can have certainty that God exists and God has revealed that to everybody
I should have shown my slides because it makes more sense when I actually when you actually I don't know see it see it
sometimes on screen sometimes that makes sense but I think you actually yeah I think that is roughly what you affirm is that uh God has
revealed it in a way
that that you can be certain that everybody is certain of it yeah yeah
um House of higma writes it's interesting David was part of Eric's presentation I
think God I thank God he changed him he's still a jerk he's uh he's a
no-nonsense person uh by the way I'm having him on a stream
on the last day of Ramadan you guys are welcome to join oh you're having David wood on that's interesting that sounds
cool name um Daniel for me for me is easy not to
believe in the Christian God I will never sacrifice my kids to God okay
well then Daniel your your world you're forced into absurdity um just so you know
that's uh the only alternative but I don't know what he wants to say there
all right um and I do want you guys to know this is important to me uh this is really
critical I mean I watched a video that you and Shannon did uh and a guy called in and you could tell from his
questioning he was he was having a hard time with um
with purpose in life and it sounded to me like from his question he was
contemplating suicide and this is really serious
um because if there is no absolute
there's no you ought not commit suicide because
human you we could just say human flourishing and it's like well I'm not adding anything to the I'm not adding to
human flourishing therefore I'm going to remove myself and make it easier for people to flourish now I'm no longer
anybody who is a quote burden to society could say I'm going to take myself out so that Society could flourish and we
could talk all of society into going look this is good this is this is going to help us we're going to we're going to
do better there's going to be more food to go around because we don't have this baggage and there's no you now have no
standard to say don't take your own life this is very serious I said don't take
your own life because you're made in the image of God and it's appointed unto man wants to die and after this the judgment and you're going
to face him one day and
so when you stand before him stand before him as one who's been forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ who said I
Repent of my good works and my bad works all of it I'm sorry God I'm trusting
what you did on the cross your death and then your burial and your Resurrection the one who who did that died buried in
Rose again and for my salvation and there it's it's it's critically important I I don't like I said I don't
say I love you out of um uh I don't just say it it's not just a phrase to me I genuinely care I can't
wait for Paul to come down and for us to just be able to hang out I I would
welcome you because it matters it really does uh God put us on this planet for a
reason I just bought the website why did godmakeme.com and I'm still figuring out
how I'm gonna do that website but people long to understand why did God make them
ultimately here's the answer if you want the shortcut he made you for a relationship with him because you matter
and and you can give him more Glory than the stars in the sky and the fish of the sea because you get to choose he didn't
make robots my oldest daughter Stephanie got married last year and every time she walks in the house her old home she's
now moved out she lives with her husband when she comes for a visit it is so
satisfying and so rewarding wow she wants to come hang out with Mom and Dad
instead of she has to God is inviting you saying Hey I want you I'm not going
to make you come I want you to have a relationship with me and it's a welcome invitation that you are welcome to but
he's not going to make you because he gets more Glory when you say God thank you thank you for giving me this world
to live in thank you for creating me thank you for giving me breath in my lungs I want to praise you I want to I want a
relationship with you that's what it's really about so I need to let my audience know I'm
very sorry we have kept Eric over time and so we will not be able to get to all of the super chats uh I did actually
want to uh see if I can throw up Vice rhinos more because Vice Rhino uh his uh his channel
is actually an anagram of your name so it's actually that's kind of just uh are you serious what is it vicist rhino
vist yeah Vis no v-i-s-e-d
-v-i-c-e-d pardon me v-i-c-e-d-e weissed rhino anyway uh and Godless engineer
hell so a friend of the channel hello thank you yeah he wants to see he's more moral of the Yahweh of course uh that
would depend on your definition of morality if you if you define morality the way Eric is that's actually impossible that breaks a lot of laws
right there so anyway and uh and I would ask do you have a
standard for Morality what is that standard and is it absolute standard because Yahweh is absolute yeah
um anyway so I do need to let Eric go so thank you so much for I all the super chats thank you perhaps I will uh
if there's any serious questions in there maybe I can forward them to Eric in case he wants to get back to anybody but um I do want to thank
you for your
time I also so I didn't mention you're with creation today Ministry how do people find you online
easiest way youtube.com creation today facebook.com creation today instagram.com creation today or my name
Eric hovind uh for the Instagram Facebook uh creationtoday.org it's uh yeah creation
today is it on there that's it right there great I got another got another problem oh was it all Paul that didn't
like that got another one whoever didn't like the property anyway yeah well thank you so much for taking time out of your
day I and uh hanging with us and we will you and I will have
background discussions about all kinds of things God and God are not God so
that's great you're very welcome thank you for being
