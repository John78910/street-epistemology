I hear you say on your channel a former Christian examining the claims of Christians sure and that's my first
every time you say that I'm like oh I just I cringe and uh I go you know that
according to Christianity Christianity is a relationship with Jesus Christ and now you would say I thought I had one
but I didn't have one so it's not like somebody can say I used to be a Christian they can only say I thought I
was a Christian and so it's really and and just like we're gonna have a conversation on morality and these these details kind of matter I go that
detail
actually matters because you're you're you're you're not being honest you're
being immoral when you if I can start off right in that sure when you present the idea I used to be a Christian and
now I'm not and I'm examining the claims of Christians so automatically I go man I you're my friend I've told you this
offline talk about it online uh somebody who's a Christian is somebody who has a
relationship with Jesus Christ who has made God the Lord of their reasoning and so for you to now reason that he is not
you can't logically say that you used to be a Christian logically all you can say is I used to be deluded into thinking I
was and now I'm no longer in your mind deluded I'm not a Christian does that
well this means up our whole conversation because that means you and I are no longer defining Christianity
the same way right and so it does make it does make weirdly sense that it's your label to adopt and so you should be
able to Define it the trouble is I talk to so many Christians and everyone defines Christian Christianity
differently so for me Christianity I believed I was a Christian but right
now I think if the definition of Christianity is someone in relationship with a risen Jesus then I don't think
anyone is a Christian right because I don't I think you are deluding yourself
into that as well I agree but you would also have to say if that is what a Christian is you can only say you were
deluded you cannot say that you are a Christian right that is well
uh yes that that would be correct that I was deluded so I I held I have thought about it's a little wordy it's not good
for Branding but I have thought about using a former a former person who used the label of Christian because that's
what I did I used the label of Christian right now if anyone comes to me with a label of Christian
